//! Concrete V8 Web API definitions and bindings.
//!
//! This crate owns the native interface catalog and self-contained Web API
//! implementations, including their declaration derives, WebIDL conversions,
//! callbacks, and template bindings. Generic declaration machinery lives in
//! `moli-webapi-declare`, and generic conversions live in `moli-webidl`.
//!
//! Realm exposure, prototype registration, and page-owned host capabilities
//! are supplied by the embedding runtime. This crate does not depend on the
//! renderer or its document and task scheduling state.
